    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Emotional resilience is the ability to adapt and thrive in the face of adversity. It is not about avoiding stress, but developing the capacity to recover and grow stronger from challenges. Resilient individuals maintain balance, optimism, and mental wellness even in difficult times.</p>
    <p>Practices such as mindfulness, self-reflection, seeking support, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle contribute to building emotional resilience. Resilience also involves embracing change, developing problem-solving skills, and cultivating a growth mindset.</p>
    <p>By strengthening emotional resilience, we prepare ourselves to navigate life’s uncertainties with confidence, compassion, and inner strength. It is a lifelong skill that benefits not only our mental health but also our relationships, careers, and overall quality of life.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In essence, mental wellness is the foundation of a fulfilling life — a conscious practice worth embracing every day.</p>
