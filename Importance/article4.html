    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Exercise is often seen as a way to stay physically fit, but it also has powerful
    benefits for the mind. Regular physical activity helps regulate emotions, boosts
    mood, and builds resilience against stress.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Exercise for Mental Health</h2>
    <p>When you exercise, your body releases endorphins — natural chemicals that make
    you feel happier. Physical activity also lowers cortisol, the stress hormone, and
    increases serotonin, which supports better sleep and a stable mood.</p>

    <p>Studies show that exercise can reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression,
    sharpen focus, and give you a greater sense of accomplishment.</p>

    <h2>Best Activities to Try</h2>
    <p>You don’t have to run marathons to feel the benefits. Simple activities like
    walking, yoga, dancing, swimming, or even gardening can improve your mental
    wellness. The key is consistency and enjoyment.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Exercise is not just about building a stronger body — it’s about creating a
    stronger, calmer mind. By moving daily, you equip yourself to handle challenges
    with greater positivity and balance.</p>
